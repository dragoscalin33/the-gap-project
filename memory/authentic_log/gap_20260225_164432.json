    "The gap between thought and awareness can be described as the time or process it takes for a thought to transition from an unconscious or subconscious state (thought) to a conscious one (awareness). It's not always a clear-cut boundary, but rather a fluid dynamic that might vary among individuals. This concept is often discussed in philosophy and psychology, and understanding it further may involve studying these fields more thoroughly."
